# My Notion Widgets
This page is simply a collection of widgets I'm using (or testing) in Notion to make me more productive. Feel free to borrow/copy/steal to make your own. If you've got something interesting you use, let me know. Thanks.

The [index.html](https://chucktomasi.github.io/notion/index.html) page contains a list of examples if you want to see what one looks like.

> Keep in mind some values (like latitude/longitude, stock price, etc) are hard coded and you'll need to modify yours accordingly.
